# Introduction
This Case is an Agent-Based Model used to simulate multi-agent interaction processes such as monkey populations, human activities, and land use (e.g., participation in the GTGP project). The project is derived from https://github.com/jrmak/FNNR-ABM-Primate.git. This version has added model validation code in FNNR/ABM/validation.py.

# Environment Setup
Due to the project's reliance on specific Python versions and libraries, an independent virtual environment must be created in the FNNR directory. The steps are as follows:

## 1. Navigate to the project directory
Open the terminal and navigate to the FNNR directory:
```
cd FNNR
```

## 2. Create a virtual environment
Use Python's built-in venv module to create a virtual environment (named venv):
```
python -m venv venv
```

## 3. Activate the virtual environment
Windows (CMD):
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/macOS (bash/zsh):
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

After activation, (venv) will appear before the terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

## 4. Install dependency libraries
Ensure the Python version in the virtual environment is 3.8.0 (check with python --version; if the version is incorrect, reinstall the corresponding version), then install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

# Running Guide
The newly added validation code in this project is located in ABM/validation.py, which is used to verify core model assumptions (e.g., the relationship between compensation amount and GTGP participation rate, the relationship between fertility rate and monkey quantity, etc.):
```
# In the virtual environment, navigate to the ABM directory
cd ABM
# Run the validation code
python validation.py
```
* The validation process and statistical analysis results will be printed directly in the console (e.g., regression coefficients, P-values, correlation analysis, etc.).
* Raw data will be saved as CSV files: samples_A.csv, samples_M.csv, samples_O.csv (corresponding to different validation levels respectively).

# Notes
* The virtual environment must use Python 3.8.0; otherwise, dependency library incompatibility may occur.
* Before running the main model, ensure that environment data files in the FNNR directory (e.g., vegetation.txt, DEM.txt, etc.) are complete; otherwise, model initialization may fail.
* Sample files generated by the validation code (samples_*.csv) will be saved in the ABM directory. To regenerate sample data, delete the old files and re-run validation.py.
